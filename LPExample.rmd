```{r lpsolve, echo=TRUE}
# Set up problem: maximize
# x1 + 9 x2 + x3 subject to
# x1 + 2 x2 + 3 x3 <= 9
# 3 x1 + 2 x2 + 2 x3 <= 15


# First, we define our objective function. We pass in the coefficients as a vector to f.obj
f.obj <- c(1, 9, 1)

# Next, we define our constraints. We pass in a matrix of the coefficients to f.con
f.con <- matrix (c(1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)

# Now we're telling it that the direction of the constraints is <=
f.dir <- c("<=", "<=")

# Lastly, we define the right hand side of the equations (the values that the constraints are tied to)
f.rhs <- c(9, 15)


# Now run.

result <- lp("max", f.obj, f.con, f.dir, f.rhs)
result

# This tells us the optimal value of the objective function
# But it does not tell us by default what values of x give it that value! 
result$solution

# What if we want the sensitivities? 
result$sens.coef.from

result$sens.coef.to

result$duals
